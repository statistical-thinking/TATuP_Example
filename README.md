# Python Code and Proof of Concept for TATuP Article
This Python code represents a supplement as proof of concept for the article "Misuse of Large
Language Models: Exploiting weaknesses for target-specific outputs" in the journal TATuP. The
article was submitted on 12/12/2023 for the special topic “The ambivalence of emergent technologies:
Malevolent creativity and civil security,” edited by G. Plattner, O. Madeira, C. Büscher, A.
Gazos and T. Röller (https://doi.org/10.14512/tatup.33.2.10).

# Authors
Prof. Dr. Dennis Klinkhammer

# Requirements
GPT4All and LangChain in Python

# Instructions
Since the latest GTP4All update and with LangChain as new standard framework for using LLMs, the use of
"external contexts" for influencing the outputs of an LLM has been further simplified. The provided Python
code originally used an external PDF document, while the updated Python code uses LangChain to achieve
the same effect.
